  Abstract =	 {Abstract We study various methods of aggregating
                  individual judgments and individual priorities in
                  group decision making with the AHP. The focus is on
                  the empirical properties of the various methods,
                  mainly on the extent to which the various
                  aggregation methods represent an accurate
                  approximation of the priority vector of interest. We
                  identify five main classes of aggregation procedures
                  which provide identical or very similar empirical
                  expressions for the vectors of interest. We also
                  propose a method to decompose in the \{AHP\}
                  response matrix distortions due to random errors and
                  perturbations caused by cognitive biases predicted
                  by the mathematical psychology literature. We test
                  the decomposition with experimental data and find
                  that perturbations in group decision making caused
                  by cognitive distortions are more important than
                  those caused by random errors. We propose methods to
                  correct the systematic distortions.},

                  approach is re-examined in view of the recent
                  developments in mathematical psychology based on the
                  so-called separable representations. The study
                  highlights the distortions in the estimates based on
                  the maximum eigenvalue method used in the \{AHP\}
                  distinguishing the contributions due to random
                  noises from the effects due to the nonlinearity of
                  the subjective weighting function of separable
                  representations. The analysis is based on the second
                  order expansion of the Perron eigenvector and Perron
                  eigenvalue in reciprocally symmetric matrices with
                  perturbations. The asymptotic distributions of the
                  Perron eigenvector and Perron eigenvalue are derived
                  and related to the eigenvalue-based index of
                  cardinal consistency used in the AHP. The results
                  show the limits of using the latter index as a rule
                  to assess the quality of the estimates of a ratio
                  scale. The \{AHP\} method to estimate the ratio
                  scales is compared with the classical ratio

  Abstract =	 {Studying how individuals compare two given
                  quantitative stimuli, say d1 and d2 , is a
                  fundamental problem. One very common way to address
                  it is through ratio estimation, that is to ask
                  individuals not to give values to d1 and d2 , but
                  rather to give their estimates of the ratio p = d1 /
                  d2 . Several psychophysical theories (the best known
                  being Stevens' power-law) claim that this ratio
                  cannot be known directly and that there are
                  cognitive distortions on the apprehension of the
                  different quantities. These theories result in the
                  so-called separable representations [Luce,
                  R. D. (2002). A psychophysical theory of intensity
                  proportions, joint presentations, and

                  Psychology, 40, 109Ã¢ÂÂ788], which include
                  Stevens' model as a special case. In this paper we
                  propose a general statistical framework that allows
                  for testing in a rigorous way whether the separable
                  representation theory is grounded or not. We
                  conclude in favor of it, but reject
                  Stevens'model. As a byproduct, we provide estimates
                  of the psychophysical functions of interest.},

                  receiving growing attention in numerical
                  analysis. An elegant solution has been provided by
                  Cui and Freeden [J. Cui, W. Freeden,
                  Equidistribution on the sphere, SIAM
                  J. Sci. Comput. 18 (2) (1997) 595–609], where a
                  class of discrepancies, called generalized
                  discrepancies and originally associated with
                  pseudodifferential operators on the unit sphere in
                  R3, has been introduced. The objective of this paper
                  is to extend to the sphere of arbitrary dimension
                  this class of discrepancies and to study their
                  numerical properties. First we show that generalized
                  discrepancies are diaphonies on the

                  characterize the sequences of points for which
                  convergence to zero of these discrepancies takes
                  place. Then we discuss the worst-case error of
                  quadrature rules and we derive a result on
                  tractability of multivariate integration on the
                  hypersphere. At last we provide several versions of
                  Koksma–Hlawka type inequalities for integration of

                  out that the limiting distribution is an (infinite)

                  formulated in terms of necessary and sufficient
                  conditions. In particular, we examine the case where
                  the probability space is endowed with a metric and
                  we discuss the validity of the Birkhoff Ergodic
                  Theorem for continuous random variables. The
                  interest of our results is illustrated by an
                  application to the convergence of statistical
                  transforms, such as the moment generating function
                  or the characteristic function, to their theoretical
                  counterparts. },

  Abstract =	 {We examine the concept of essential intersection of
                  a random set in the framework of robust optimization
                  programs and ergodic theory. Using a recent
                  extension of Birkhoff’s Ergodic Theorem developed by
                  the present authors, it is shown that essential
                  intersection can be represented as the countable
                  intersection of random sets involving an
                  asymptotically mean stationary transformation. This
                  is applied to the approximation of a robust
                  optimization program by a sequence of simpler
                  programs with only a finite number of
                  constraints. We also discuss some formulations of
                  robust optimization programs that have appeared in
                  the literature and we make them more precise,
                  especially from the probabilistic point of view. We
                  show that the essential intersection appears
                  naturally in the correct formulation.},

  issn =	 {1533-4406},
  doi =		 {10.1056/NEJMoa1702747},
  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that long-term
                  exposure to air pollution increases
                  mortality. However, evidence is limited for
                  air-pollution levels below the most recent National
                  Ambient Air Quality Standards. Previous studies
                  involved predominantly urban populations and did not
                  have the statistical power to estimate the health
                  effects in underrepresented groups.  METHODS: We
                  constructed an open cohort of all Medicare
                  beneficiaries (60,925,443 persons) in the
                  continental United States from the years 2000
                  through 2012, with 460,310,521 person-years of
                  follow-up. Annual averages of fine particulate
                  matter (particles with a mass median aerodynamic
                  diameter of less than 2.5 μm [PM2.5]) and ozone were
                  estimated according to the ZIP Code of residence for
                  each enrollee with the use of previously validated
                  prediction models. We estimated the risk of death
                  associated with exposure to increases of 10 μg per
                  cubic meter for PM2.5 and 10 parts per billion (ppb)
                  for ozone using a two-pollutant Cox
                  proportional-hazards model that controlled for
                  demographic characteristics, Medicaid eligibility,
                  and area-level covariates.  RESULTS: Increases of 10
                  μg per cubic meter in PM2.5 and of 10 ppb in ozone
                  were associated with increases in all-cause
                  mortality of 7.3\% (95\% confidence interval [CI],
                  7.1 to 7.5) and 1.1\% (95\% CI, 1.0 to 1.2),
                  respectively. When the analysis was restricted to
                  person-years with exposure to PM2.5 of less than 12
                  μg per cubic meter and ozone of less than 50 ppb,
                  the same increases in PM2.5 and ozone were
                  associated with increases in the risk of death of
                  13.6\% (95\% CI, 13.1 to 14.1) and 1.0\% (95\% CI,
                  0.9 to 1.1), respectively. For PM2.5, the risk of
                  death among men, blacks, and people with Medicaid
                  eligibility was higher than that in the rest of the
                  population.  CONCLUSIONS: In the entire Medicare
                  population, there was significant evidence of
                  adverse effects related to exposure to PM2.5 and
                  ozone at concentrations below current national
                  standards. This effect was most pronounced among
                  self-identified racial minorities and people with
                  low income. (Supported by the Health Effects

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Despite dramatic air quality improvement
                  in the United States over the past decades, recent
                  years have brought renewed scrutiny and uncertainty
                  surrounding the effectiveness of specific regulatory
                  programs for continuing to improve air quality and
                  public health outcomes.  METHODS: We employ causal
                  inference methods and a spatial hierarchical
                  regression model to characterize the extent to which
                  a designation of "nonattainment" with the 1997
                  National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ambient
                  fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in 2005 causally
                  affected ambient PM2.5 and health outcomes among
                  over 10 million Medicare beneficiaries in the
                  Eastern United States in 2009-2012.  RESULTS: We
                  found that, on average across all retained study
                  locations, reductions in ambient PM2.5 and Medicare
                  health outcomes could not be conclusively attributed
                  to the nonattainment designations against the
                  backdrop of other regional strategies that impacted
                  the entire Eastern United States. A more targeted
                  principal stratification analysis indicates
                  substantial health impacts of the nonattainment
                  designations among the subset of areas where the
                  designations are estimated to have actually reduced
                  ambient PM2.5 beyond levels achieved by regional
                  measures, with noteworthy reductions in all-cause
                  mortality, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder,
                  heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and
                  respiratory tract infections.  DISCUSSION: These
                  findings provide targeted evidence of the
                  effectiveness of local control measures after
                  nonattainment designations for the 1997 PM2.5 air
